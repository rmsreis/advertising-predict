# Predict Sales Revenue with scikit-learn
-------------------------------------------------

This is an example of simple linear regression model to predict sales and revenue using Python. 
I employed scikit-learn module for calculating the linear regression, while using pandas for data management, and seaborn for plotting. 

Explain the core ideas of linear regression to technical and non-technical audience

<h2 align="center">Simple Linear Regression</h2>

Linear Regression is a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response.

We have an input vector $X^T = (X_1, X_2,...,X_p)$ , and want to predict a real-valued output $Y$. The linear regression model has the form.

$f(x) = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p X_j \beta_j$.

The linear model either assumes that the regression function $E(Y|X)$ is linear, or that the linear model is a reasonable approximation.

Here the $\beta_j$'s are unknown parameters or coefficients, and the variables $X_j$ can come from different sources. No matter the source of $X_j$, the model is linear in the parameters.


### Dataset:

You will be working with the very popular Advertising data set to predict sales revenue based on 
The dataset consists of advertising spending through mediums such as TV, radio, and newspaper.
